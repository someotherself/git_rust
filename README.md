# ü¶Ä git-rust ‚Äî A Git CLI clone Written in Rust

git-rust is a simplified Git implementation built from scratch in Rust. It mimics core Git functionality such as init, hash-object, and cat-file, and serves both as a learning project and a functional Git-like CLI.

This project explores how Git works under the hood ‚Äî from creating repositories and hashing objects, to writing Git-compliant blob files and reading them back from the .git/objects directory.

# ‚ú® Current Features

    git-rust init ‚Äî Initialize a new Git-like repository. Does not re-initialize a repo.

    git-rust hash-object -w <file> ‚Äî Hash and write blob objects to .git/objects

    git-rust cat-file -p <hash> ‚Äî Decode and print stored objects

    Fully compatible object format (blob <size>\0<content>) using zlib compression

    Built with safety, performance, and testability in mind using idiomatic Rust

# üõ†Ô∏è Why This Project?

This project is ideal if you want to:

    Understand Git internals by building them yourself

    Learn about SHA-1 hashing, zlib compression, and Git‚Äôs object model

    Practice building command-line tools and file-based data structures in Rust

## The INDEX file (staging area)
It uses a binary layour (raw bytes) and always big-endian format.
The index has a header that is 12 bytes, a record of entries (files/blobs) added to the staging area and a checksum (SHA-1) of all the content (header + entries).
The entries are not a fixed length, but a multiple of 8 bytes:
- 62 bytes of fixed-size metadata (ctime, mtime, mode, sha1, etc.).
- A null terminated, variable-length path (the filename or relative path), which follows the metadata. 
- 1‚Äì8 bytes of padding to ensure the total size of the entry is a multiple of 8 bytes.


Example of the Header:
| **Field**     | **Size (Bytes)** | **Description**                                       | **Example (Hex)**                    |

| `Version` | 4                | Version 2, 3 or 4. 2 is most common                            | `00 00 00 00`                        |
